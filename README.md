# I-O

## Instructions:

- Read integers from two text files called "input1.txt" and "input2.txt". Each integer is on a new line in the respective files.
- Merge the contents of the two input files, maintaining the original order of the integers, and write the result to a new text file called "merged.txt".
- Identify the integers that are present in both input files.
- Write the integers that are present in both input files to a new text file called "common.txt".
- Handle any exceptions that might occur during the process, such as FileNotFoundException, IOException, and NumberFormatException. Use try-catch blocks as needed.
